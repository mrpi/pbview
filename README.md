# pbview
Read protobuf messages without deserialization

If you only need to read a few fields of large Google Protocol Buffer messages you can use this library to do this much faster than with the original google/protobuf parser.

The pbview compiler (pbviewc) generates classes that have the same (read-only) interface as the C++ classes generated by the protobuf compiler (protoc).

# Requirements
- C++17 compiler
- google/protobuf
- range-v3

# Features
- The parser seekes fast to the requested fields. Large sub-messages and strings can be skipped
- Working with serialized messages has significant lower memory consumptions than holding deserialized messages in memory
- No memory allocations (std::string_view directly pointing into the serialized message, instead of std::string)
- Variant types that contain either a binary view or a google::protobuf::Message  

# Drawbacks
Please note, that every field access requires a (partial) parsing of the containing message.

This means, that there is always a break-even point at which the deserialization of the message is faster.
(It is easy to deserialize only single sub-messages of larger structs with this library.) 

Benchmark your exact use-cases and than make a well-founded decision!
